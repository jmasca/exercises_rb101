# Class and Instance Methods

**`File::path`** vs. **`File#path`**

The initial difference is what each method is called on.

***Class Methods*** are called on the **class** itself, whereas ***Instance Methods*** are called on **objects** of a class.

<br>

#### `File::path`

- This is a **Class** method, meaning `path` will be called directly on the `File` class.

- ```ruby
  File.path("/tmp")
  ```

<br>

#### `File#path`

- This is an **Instance** method, meaning `path` will be called on an instance/ object of the class.

- ```ruby
  f = File.new("some_file.txt")
  puts f.path
  
  # f is an instance of the File class which 'path' is then called on.
  ```
