# Mandatory Blocks

### `Array#bsearch`

- Uses a binary search algorithm to return the selected element as determined by a given block.

- In the Ruby Documentation,  `Binary Searching`  will provide the necessary explanation / examples:
  
  - `Array#bsearch`  takes a block and only a block.
  
  - The collection should be sorted, but this is not checked.
  
  - Has two search modes:
    
    1. `Find-minimum`  mode (the usual use case):
       
       - returns the first element for which the block returns  `true`
       
       - The block  _must_  return  `true`  or  `false`
       
       - The block  _should_  evaluate all  `false`  elements before evaluating a  `true`  element
    
    2. `Find-any`  mode:
       
       - returns some element for which the block returns  `0`, or  `nil`  if no such element is found.
       
       - the block  _must_  return a numeric value
       
       - the block  _should_  evaluate in the order of  `1`,  `0`, and then  `-1`

Problem Case:

- Search the Array,  `a`, to find the first element whose value exceeds  `8`.

- ```ruby
  a = [1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 19]
  
  # Note: The array is already sorted.
  ```

- We'll use the  `find-minimum`  mode:
  
  - ```ruby
    value = a.bsearch { |e| e > 8 }
    puts value  # => 11
    ```
