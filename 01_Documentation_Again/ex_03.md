# Default Arguments in the Middle

According to the Ruby Documentation:

- Arguments may have default values.

- The default value does not need to appear first, but arguments with defaults must be grouped together.

When dealing with this method and method call:

```ruby
def my_method(a, b = 2, c = 3, d)
  p [a, b, c, d]
end

my_method(4, 5, 6)
```

The code will print an array containing the 3 given values at `a`, `b`, and `d`, and the default value for `c`.

So the output will be `[4, 5, 3, 6]`.

- `my_method` is being defined with two default values and two required values (it accepts 2..4 values).
  
  - The first value, `4`, is assigned to `a`.
  
  - The second value, `5`, is assigned to `b`.
  
  - Now we're on the last value, `6`:
    
    - `c` has a default value, but `d` does not.
    
    - Ruby understands this and will distribute the given value accordingly.
      
      > Ruby fills in the missing arguments from left to right.
      
      - `d` will be assigned the last value of `6`.
      
      - `c` will use its default value, `3`, since no further values have been provided.

- Therefore, the output is `[4, 5, 3, 6]`.
