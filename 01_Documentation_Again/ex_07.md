# Parent Class

<br>

The code:

```ruby
s = 'abc'
puts s.public_methods.inspect
```

Prints a list of all public methods available to the String `s`.

- This is all of the methods defined in the `String` class.

- It's Parents' methods inherited from the `Object` class.

- And inherited methods of the `Object` class which include the `BasicObject` class and `Kernel` module.

<br>

In the `String` documentation there is no `#public_methods` method available. However, all subclasses, such as `String`, have a Parent class whose methods it inherits. The Parent class of `String` is the `Object` class and this is where we'll find the `#public_methods` method.

<br>

`Object#public_methods`

- This method takes an optional boolean argument, `all`.
  
  - The default value is `true` which returns all methods of the object, as well as its inherited methods.
  
  - In our example, `true` was omitted, so by default `all` is set to `true`.
  
  - This is why we have a list of methods belonging to the `String` class and it's Parents' methods.

- If we set the `all` argument to `false`:
  
  - We'll see a list of methods belonging to only the object that called `#public_methods`.
  
  - For our example, this means only methods found directly in the `String` class would be shown.
  
  - ```ruby
    s = 'abc'
    puts s.public_methods(false).inspect
    ```
